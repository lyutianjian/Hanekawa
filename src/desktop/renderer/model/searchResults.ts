/**
 * The search family's result list (T15, design §6.2 检索): what a `Grep` or
 * `Glob` result's `content` parses into, so the view can group it by file and
 * make every path a jump into the editor.
 *
 * The two tools print plain text — `Grep` one `path:line:match` row per hit
 * (ripgrep's own format; the Node fallback adds a space after the second
 * colon), `Glob` one path per line — and that text is the only structured data
 * the records carry. Parsing it here, in `model/`, keeps the DOM half dumb and
 * the rules testable as pure functions, the same split `ansi.ts` made for the
 * shell family.
 *
 * **Strict on purpose.** A payload is a search result only when *every*
 * non-empty line is a row (or the tool's own pagination notice) — anything
 * else is an error string, a `No matches found.`, or a multiline `rg -U` match
 * with its `--` separators, and the answer is `undefined`: the step then falls
 * back to the plain body (§6.2 兜底), which shows the text without lying about
 * what it is. A family that half-parsed its input would group an error message
 * under a path nobody clicked.
 *
 * DOM-free like every `model/` module — the base tsconfig program has no DOM
 * lib and `test/` imports this directly.
