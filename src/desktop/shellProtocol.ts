 * The shell protocol: what the single desktop window's `__shell` lane carries.
 *
 * Session traffic (36 `HostCommand`s and their events) flows on per-pane lanes
 * untouched. This is the lane *beside* them — the one that speaks for the
 * window rather than for any one session, so the renderer can ask about and
 * steer the lane topology itself.
 *
 * Deliberately small. Commands answer "what lanes exist", "open or focus a
 * session as a lane", and "open a project"; events announce topology changes
 * and activation requests. Settings live here too in phase 4d — a settings
 * screen is a window-level surface, not a session view — which is why the lane
 * exists from the start rather than being bolted on later.
 *
 * The reply/fail envelopes are the same shapes `SessionClient` speaks, so the
 * renderer's shell client reuses `PendingRequests` and the fail path unchanged.
 * Only this file is shared with the renderer, so it must stay browser-safe:
 * type-only imports, no zod (the host-side schemas live in `shellHost.ts`),
 * no Node builtins.
