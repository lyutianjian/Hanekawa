/**
 * Everything one session leaves on disk, deleted in one place.
 *
 * This exists because "delete a session" had no owner. `SessionStore.delete`
 * removes three files and an index entry — which is all it can, since the other
 * artifacts belong to modules that sit *above* `sessions/` in the layering and
 * calling back down would be a cycle. So the composition has to live somewhere,
 * and until this module it lived in the Electron shell: `ShellHost.deleteSession`
 * called the store and then removed the session's snapshots, which left two more
 * directories behind, and any second deletion path (a `/delete` command, a TUI
 * list, a cleanup job) would have started from zero and leaked all three.
 *
 * `runtime/` is the layer that already depends on both `harness/` and
 * `services/`, so it is the only place the full list can be named.
 *
 * **Adding an artifact goes here.** If a feature starts writing
 * `.myagent/<something>/<sessionId>`, this function is what makes it removable.

 * accepts a prefix but every path below turns the string into a directory or
 * filename, so a prefix would delete the right index entry and miss (or worse,
 * mis-target) the rest. The guard is the store's own, and it rejects `''`, `'.'`,
 * `'..'` and anything carrying a separator — two of the removals below are
 * `recursive`, and `path.join(dir, '')` is `dir`.
 *
 * Best-effort per artifact and sequential: the store goes first because its index
 * entry is what makes the session *visible*, so a failure later leaves an
 * orphaned directory rather than a row pointing at a half-deleted session.
