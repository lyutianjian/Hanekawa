/**
 * The complete human-in-the-loop surface of the runtime.
 *
 * Every proxy here is a stable object created before any UI exists, holding a
 * mutable handler that the UI installs once it is ready and removes when it
 * goes away. The runtime only ever sees the function signatures, so the same
 * assembly works for the Ink TUI, a desktop shell, or a headless caller.
 *
 * Two directions are represented: `record` is a one-way push out of the
 * runtime, the other four are blocking request/response calls into the UI.
 * The pre-mount fallbacks are deliberately different per bridge — see each
 * factory — and must not be unified.
 *
 * `prompt` is the one bridge that *parks* rather than answering while no UI is
 * attached: a permission request that arrives too early waits for a UI instead
 * of being silently denied. The other three answer immediately, because
 * headless callers (PlanModeManager driven directly, unit tests with no React
 * tree) depend on that and would otherwise hang.
 *
 * All four settle their in-flight work through `drainPending()` when the UI is
 * gone for good. That backstop is load-bearing: `ToolRunner.run` does not pass
 * its abort signal into `PermissionGate.approve`, so a prompt that never
 * settles hangs the tool call forever no matter what the user cancels.
