 * "what does the whole tab topology look like". It exists because the Electron
 * main process cannot be tested (`app.requestSingleInstanceLock()` runs at module
 * top level, so `main.ts` cannot even be imported under plain node), and every
 * decision that used to live in a module-level variable there is a decision
 * nothing could cover. Windows, dialogs and channels stay in the shell; the
 * bookkeeping lives here.
 *
 * What is deliberately *not* here: `bootstrap()`. The shell owns the MCP trust
 * prompt and the error dialogs, so it builds the project and hands the assembled
 * halves to {@link ProjectDirectory.add}. That keeps this module free of the
 * filesystem and makes the tests plain object literals.
