/**
 * Copy non-TypeScript assets (the renderer's `index.html`, `styles.css`,
 * `fonts.css`, and the `fonts/` webfont directory) into the build output after
 * `tsc` and `esbuild` finish. Two prior stages of `npm run build:desktop`
 * already wrote the compiled `.js` files; this script makes the corresponding
 * `.html` available where `desktop/main.ts` reads it
 * (`<dest>/desktop/renderer/index.html`), and everything the HTML links beside
 * it — `loadFile` resolves `./styles.css`, `./fonts.css`, and the
 * `./fonts/*.woff2` referenced by the sheet and the preload tags relative to
 * the page, so a missing copy is an unstyled or fallback-font window rather
 * than a build error.
 *
 * Single files go through the `sources` list (`[from, to]` pairs); whole
 * trees go through `directories` and are mirrored with
 * `cpSync(from, to, { recursive: true })` — Node 22 native, no new dependency.
 * KaTeX's sheet and faces are a third stage at the bottom, because they come
 * from `node_modules` rather than from `src/` and the sheet is rewritten on the
 * way out; the comment there says why.
 *
 * Kept as a standalone file rather than an `npm run` chain to avoid quoting
 * headaches on Windows where `&&` inside JSON script strings is fussy and `cp`
 * is not a builtin.
 *
 * Usage: `node scripts/copy-desktop-assets.mjs [destRoot]`
 *
 * `destRoot` defaults to `<repo>/dist`. It is a parameter because the source
 * path has to stay anchored to this file (so the script works from any cwd)
 * while the destination must be redirectable — `test/desktopBuild.test.ts`
 * builds into a temp directory, and a script that always wrote into the repo's
 * `dist/` would both miss the assertion and scribble on a directory another
 * test file is rebuilding in a sibling process.

/*
 * KaTeX's stylesheet and the faces it names, taken from the installed package
 * rather than checked in beside the others.
 *
 * That is the one difference from the webfonts above, and it is deliberate: the
 * `@fontsource` packages are devDependencies used once as a source of bytes,
 * while `katex` is a real runtime dependency already bundled into `app.js`. Its
 * CSS and its fonts have to match the version that bundle was built from, so
 * reading them from `node_modules` at copy time is what keeps the three in step
 * — a `npm update katex` that changed a metric would otherwise leave stale
 * glyphs in `src/`.
 *
 * The `woff` and `ttf` sources are dropped and only the woff2 are carried: the
 * three formats are the same 20 faces three times over, 1.2 MB against 296 KB,
 * and Chromium — the only engine this page runs in — has taken woff2 since 36.
 * Stripping the sources as well as the files matters, because `default-src
 * 'self'` turns a fallback `url()` for a file nobody copied into a console error
 * per equation rather than a silent miss.
 *
 * The destination is `desktop/renderer/fonts/`, shared with the app's own
 * faces: the sheet's `url(fonts/KaTeX_…woff2)` is relative to itself, and it
 * sits at `desktop/renderer/katex.css`. So the two families land in one
 * directory and no path in the vendored CSS has to be rewritten.
