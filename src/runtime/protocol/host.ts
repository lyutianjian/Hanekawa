   * between the shells, and this is where the desktop's answer lives: a pending
   * *blocking* request, not any open panel. The `/rewind` panel and the pickers
   * hold the user, not the agent loop, so they do not stop the queue.
   *
   * Fire-and-forget by design. Every trigger (an enqueue, a turn ending, a

   * the work is detached and the tail re-checks rather than looping: after an
   * await this is a fresh microtask, not recursion.

   * rather than load-bearing, and it is worth knowing which is which. What
   * actually stops a closed pane from pumping is `dispose()` draining
   * `this.teardown`, which unsubscribes the snapshot and queue listeners — remove
   * either check by mutation and the suite stays green, because nothing calls this
   * afterwards. They are kept for the same reason `post()` carries one: the cost
   * is a branch, and the failure they guard against is a real turn starting on a
   * host nobody is listening to, with the bridges already detached so every
   * permission prompt inside it auto-denies. The second one, after the await,
   * covers a race the suite cannot hit deterministically — `dequeue()` writes to
   * disk, and a `dispose()` landing inside that await is past the first check.
