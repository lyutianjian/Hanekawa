/**
 * The sidebar as DOM.
 *
 * Four fixed regions, following `design_guidance.md` 三.2 top to bottom: the
 * session search box, the first-level actions, a scrolling middle of workspace
 * groups, and a footer carrying 设置 and the `?` panel. All four live in one
 * shell held at the open width; the stylesheet takes `#sidebar` around it to zero
 * — the one collapse control is the title bar's `.titlebar-rail`.
 *
 * The fold is the third thing this file owns that the model cannot: the phase
 * comes in on the view, but the *evidence* that a move finished is a
 * `transitionend` (or the timer standing in for one that never ran), and both are
 * DOM. It reports them back as `collapse-settled` and lets `nextCollapsePhase`
 * decide what they mean.
 *
 * The header that used to sit above the search box is gone with the workspace
 * dropdown it held: every workspace now has a heading *in the list*, so a control
 * whose job was to choose which one you could see had nothing left to do.
 *
 * Every decision — which rows exist, what order they are in, what a keystroke
 * means, whether a row is asking for confirmation — belongs to
 * `model/sidebar.ts`. This file turns those into nodes and events, and owns
 * exactly two things the model cannot: the `keydown` that feeds
 * `sidebarKeyToIntent` only while focus is inside the sidebar, and the
 * `focusout` that withdraws a pending delete when the user's attention leaves.
 *
 * That second one is why no rank had to be added to `resolveKey`: a delete
 * confirmation scoped to sidebar focus cannot become a dialog that is drawn but
 * unanswerable, which is the trap the per-pane overlay rules exist to avoid.
 *
 * No `innerHTML` — session titles and project names are filesystem- and
 * model-authored. The `el()` helper is the enforcement.
