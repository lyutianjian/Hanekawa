/**
 * The user-facing half of image failures (design §13, session S24): one place
 * that turns a distinguishable reason into words and into the way out.
 *
 * The layers that *detect* a failure already name it — the processing pipeline,
 * the attachment store, the turn-image gate, the provider's final check all
 * answer with a reason plus the facts (file name, byte counts, limits). What
 * they do not carry is what the user can do next, and both shells were showing
 * only the facts. This module supplies the missing half, so the desktop strip,
 * the desktop notices, and the TUI system messages say the same thing about the
 * same reason instead of each inventing copy.
 *
 * Pure, like `types.ts`, and for the same reason: the renderer, the TUI, the
 * harness, and the protocol host all read it, and the renderer may not
 * value-import `harness/` or `services/`.
 *
 * Deliberately *not* a catch-all error formatter. `imageBlockReasonOf` answers
 * `undefined` for anything that is not a recognized image block, so an HTTP
 * error, a bad endpoint, or a provider outage keeps its own words — claiming an
 * image reason for those would be a lie about what went wrong (design §13:
 * 不谎称已避免).
