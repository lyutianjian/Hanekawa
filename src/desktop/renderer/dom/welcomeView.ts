/**
 * The empty-state screen as DOM.
 *
 * Mounted inside the pane's own subtree rather than as a singleton panel, so it
 * is hidden with the rest of a backgrounded pane and one pane's Hero can never
 * be left painted over another's conversation.
 *
 * Every decision is `model/welcome.ts`'s, including whether this is visible at
 * all. Four things belong here and nowhere else: the masthead is one block —
 * wordmark over Hero — because the stylesheet hangs both off a single rule down
 * its left edge, and two blocks would need two rules; the Hero line is assembled
 * from three view fields so the project name can be its own node in the middle
 * of a sentence; the hint row is `<span>`s, and so is any pill the model says is
 * not a control — a button that does nothing when clicked is a worse lie than
 * plain text; and each switchable pill carries its popover in an anchor of its
 * own, built by `pillAnchor` below.
 *
 * The scaffolding — the masthead, the title row, the pill and hint shells, and
 * the two pill anchors — is built **once** and only its contents are replaced.
 * The anchors in particular have to survive: the popover inside one is the node
 * that takes focus when it opens, and rebuilding it around that focus would blur
 * it and fire the `focusout` that closes the popover the click just opened.
