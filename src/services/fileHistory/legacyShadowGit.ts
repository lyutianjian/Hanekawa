/**
 * Removes the shadow-git repos the previous checkpoint implementation left in
 * `<cwd>/.myagent/shadow-git/`.
 *
 * Those repos sat *inside* the worktree and stored a compressed copy of the
 * whole tree per session per turn, so a project that ran the old implementation
 * for a while is carrying tens of gigabytes that nothing will ever read again:
 * `/rewind` now addresses restores through `~/.myagent/file-history/`, and no
 * code path can open a shadow repo any more.
 *
 * Best-effort and silent. It runs on every project bootstrap rather than behind
 * a marker file because after the first successful removal the directory is
 * gone and the call is one `rm` on a missing path.
