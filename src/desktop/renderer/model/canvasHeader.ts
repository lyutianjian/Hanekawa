 * editor" on the right. The two items the document puts beside it (split view,
 * right inspector) have no backend and are omitted, per the stage-5 decision
 * table.
 *
 * Derived entirely from `WireLaneInfo`, which already carries the session id,
 * its title, and the project the lane belongs to — and which the host
 * re-broadcasts on a rename (`sessionTitle` is a lane field). So the header is a
 * *window*-level view like the sidebar: it never reaches into a `PaneSession`,
 * and `paneSession.ts` needs no new dependency for it.
 *
 * Pure, DOM-free, and therefore unit-tested directly; `dom/canvasHeaderView.ts`
 * only turns this into nodes.
