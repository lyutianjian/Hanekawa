/**
 * Waiting for the page to say something.
 *
 * `tab.wait_for_load` answers "is the navigation over"; this answers "is the
 * thing I need there yet", which is the question a single-page app actually
 * makes you ask — the load finished long before the list rendered.
 *
 * Electron-free, like `input.ts`, and for the same reason: everything
 * interesting here is the loop's behaviour at the edges, which needs a stub
 * evaluator and an injectable clock, not a window.
 *
 * Two decisions worth keeping:
 *
 * - **A timeout reports what it saw.** The last observation travels with the
 *   error, so "the button never appeared" can be told apart from "the page was
 *   still showing a spinner" without a second round trip. Before the first
 *   observation lands it says so in as many words.
 * - **`stableForMs` is continuous.** A poll that misses restarts the clock, and
 *   so does a document swap: stability on the page being left says nothing.
 * - **A navigation mid-wait is evidence, not a failure.** The condition is about
 *   the document the tab ends up on; a document swap is noted in the answer and
 *   the wait continues, because refusing would leave the model with nothing.
