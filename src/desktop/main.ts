/**
 * The Electron main process.
 *
 * Single window, N live panes. One `BrowserWindow` owns one lane multiplexer
 * over its IPC channel; each pane is a lane carrying an untouched
 * `SessionHost`, and the reserved `__shell` lane carries a `ShellHost` — the
 * class every lane/project decision lives in, because nothing in this file is
 * testable (`app.requestSingleInstanceLock()` runs at module top level, so
 * `main.ts` cannot even be imported under plain node). What stays here: the
 * `BrowserWindow`'s lifecycle, the native dialogs, and `bootstrap()` — the
 * shell owns the MCP trust prompt and the error boxes, the same split
 * `ProjectDirectory` already draws.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *  1. `ensureProject(cwd)` is the only way a project comes into existence, and
 *     the first project goes through it exactly like the fifth. Inside it,
 *     `bootstrap()` runs with a synchronous `confirmMcpTrust` that drives
 *     `dialog.showMessageBoxSync` for each untrusted MCP server — this fires
 *     before any channel exists, the only place a pre-channel prompt can live.
 *     Every project is entered through a *new empty session* — `openProject`
 *     from startup/`--cwd=`/the picker, or the shell's on-demand path when a
 *     history row of a not-yet-open project is clicked. Startup resolves the
 *     directory from the "added projects" registry (the project of the most
 *     recent session anywhere), falling back to the global workspace — the
 *     home directory, whose records land in `~/.myagent`. The registry keeps
 *     *added* order and re-opening does not move an entry, because it is also
 *     the sidebar's group order.
 *  2. `ensureShell()` builds the one window there is, wires the transport,
 *     the mux and the `ShellHost`, then loads the page. The initial lane opens
 *     after the window is up: the renderer's startup pulls the topology with
 *     `panes` rather than trusting anything posted before it attached
 *     (Electron drops pre-load IPC), so the ordering is a convenience, not a
 *     correctness requirement.
 *  3. A project is shut down when its last lane closes (`ShellHost.detachLane`)
 *     — `ProjectRuntime.shutdown` is the only call that stops background tasks
 *     and MCP clients, so a lane-less project would leave child processes
 *     running with nothing on screen to stop them.
 *  4. On `before-quit` we tear every lane down in order and wait for it, then
 *     shut every project down — but only up to `SHUTDOWN_DEADLINE_MS`. The
 *     window is destroyed in the first half of `teardown()`, so a project that
 *     never finishes draining used to leave a running process with nothing on
 *     screen. `window-all-closed` quits only when there are no panes left.
 *
 * Two keys, and they are not interchangeable: lane keys are minted by the
 * `ShellHost` and never move (session ids travel under `/clear` and `/resume`),
 * and the project map inside `ProjectDirectory` is keyed by the normalized
 * project root.
 *
 * The `node:fs` imports and the wall-clock commands stay here, never in the
 * renderer bundle.
