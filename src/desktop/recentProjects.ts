/**
 * The persisted "added projects" registry — the desktop shell's memory of
 * which projects exist, in the order they were *added* (first added first).
 *
 * The order is stable on purpose: it is exactly the order the sidebar draws its
 * project groups in, so re-opening a project must not move it. It used to be
 * most-recently-opened-first, which meant clicking `+` on a closed project (or
 * opening one of its history rows) bootstrapped it, rewrote the registry, and
 * made its group jump to the top of the sidebar under the user's cursor.
 *
 * Everything the old startup flow knew only through `process.cwd()` lives here:
 * which project a fresh launch opens (the one whose newest session is the
 * newest anywhere — the literal "最近一次会话的目录"), and which projects the
 * sidebar lists even though their runtimes are not open. The home directory is
 * deliberately *not* a member: it is the implicit global workspace every
 * session falls back to, so it is a candidate in every resolution and never
 * needs registering.
 *
 * Plain-node testable on purpose — this is main-process state `main.ts` cannot
 * cover (`app.requestSingleInstanceLock()` runs at module top level), the same
 * reason `ShellHost` and `ProjectDirectory` exist.
