/**
 * Paints the transcript: loose items interleaved with activity groups (§2).
 *
 * There is no in-flight tool line any more. It was a singleton strip under the
 * scroller that named whatever tool was running, which since T4 is something the
 * running step's own head says — with its bead, its arguments and its elapsed
 * time — one line above where the strip used to sit. Two places saying the same
 * thing is one place too many, and the strip was the one that could not say
 * *which* of a batch's calls it meant.
 *
 * ## Two layers of disclosure
 *
 * A group is a whole turn: its head carries the boundary and the total, and each
 * step inside opens on its own. Every head is a `<button>` with `aria-expanded`,
 * and a folded body is **absent rather than `hidden`**: the transcript is
 * `aria-live="polite"`, so a hidden-but-present streaming block is text a screen
 * reader announces that nobody asked for (§8).
 *
 * ## Nodes are reused by id
 *
 * The file used to rebuild the whole subtree on every paint, and its header said
 * the fix — keying by id — could wait for a profile. §8 brought that day forward
 * for a correctness reason instead: steps now collapse *by themselves* when the
 * turn ends, which shortens the content above the reader. The browser's
 * `overflow-anchor` absorbs exactly that, but only while the anchor node survives
 * the paint; a `replace()` of the whole column destroys it and the reader is
 * thrown to a different place in the conversation.
 *
 * So each entry and each step keeps its element across paints, keyed by id. An
 * unchanged item is left untouched (its markdown is not even re-parsed); a changed
 * one is refilled *in place*, so the node the anchor points at is still there.
 *
 * Keeping the *element* is only half of it: it also has to stay **attached**. A
 * `replaceChildren` of the column, or a `replace()` of a group's contents, removes
 * every child and puts it back — and a node that leaves the document has its CSS
 * animations cancelled and restarted, and stops being an anchor the browser can
 * hold a scroll position by. That is what made `unfold` (220ms, on every open
 * step) replay once per streamed token: the open thinking body pumped up from zero
 * height on every delta and shoved the answer below it around. Every insertion
 * here goes through `reconcile`, which touches only the children that moved, and
 * the group's own children are keyed nodes for exactly that reason.
 *
 * The jump-to-bottom button is built here rather than in `paneSession.ts` because
 * every piece of scroll knowledge in the renderer already lives in this file, and
 * `paneSession.ts` has no unit tests. It is appended to a host *outside* the
 * scroller: an absolutely positioned child of a scroll container would anchor to
 * the bottom of the content rather than to the viewport.

/**
 * A step's expanded body, by family (§6.2).
 *
 * The edit family is a real diff: the unified patch the tools ship in
 * `display.detail` (T12), parsed back into the same rows the permission dialog
 * paints — line gutters included. Its result summary is not repeated above the
 * rows; the head already says what file and how much.
 *
 * The shell family is a terminal block (T14): the command's own output with its
 * ANSI escapes stripped, on the card surface. Its head already says what ran and
 * how long, so the body is the output alone — except a failure's error code,
 * which §6.2 gives a line of its own above the block. The whole block reddens
 * with the step's `failed` class, the stylesheet's half of that rule.
 *
 * The search family (T15) is the grouped list: a `Grep`'s hits under their own
 * file, a `Glob`'s paths one row each, every path a jump into the editor
 * (`open-in-editor`, via the pane). The rows are controls, like every step
 * head — hover is the whole affordance, and the accessible name says what a
 * click opens.
 *
 * The read family (T16) is the file itself, as a code block with its own line
 * numbers — no syntax highlighting (§6.4 暂不做); the structure a code body
 * owes is lines and numbers, and colour would have to be a highlighter's.
 *
 * The Agent family (T16) is the conversation the call stands for: the task the
 * parent handed the sub-agent and the sub-agent's answer — prose, so markdown,
 * not a terminal — with the run's own model and tool count already in the head.
 *
 * The web family (T16) is the fetched page, which arrives *as* markdown — the
 * tool converts before it returns — rendered as the article it is rather than
 * the marker soup a plain body would print.
 *
 * Everything else is still the fallback family (§6.2 兜底): the result's own
 * summary over `detail ?? content` — which is also what an edit step without a
 * parseable patch gets, an old record's `Edited x` among them (§10), without
 * erroring.
 *
 * Nothing to show yields no body at all rather than an empty box: a call with no
 * result yet is the common case, and an empty disclosure is noise.
