   *    that is going away.
   * 3. The slot, which unregisters the runtime's tool array and its plan-slug
   *    provider.
   * 4. The scope last, which puts the four bridges back to their pre-mount
   *    fallbacks and settles whatever was still parked.

   * discards the session; closing a pane is closer to `/resume` switching away
   * — the session is still on disk and can be reopened, `restoreSession`'s
