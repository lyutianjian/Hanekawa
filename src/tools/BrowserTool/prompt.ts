export const DESCRIPTION = `Drive a real browser: open tabs, navigate, and read pages as text the way a person sees them.

Unlike WebFetch, this runs a full browser: JavaScript executes, logins persist between calls, and what you read is the rendered page rather than its HTML source. The user sees the same tabs in a side panel and can take a tab back at any time.

Every call names an \`operation\`. The fields each one takes:

- \`browser.get_state\` — no fields. Lists this session's tabs: tabId, url, title, flags. Downloads are never saved: a download a page starts is cancelled, and a line under the table names each blocked file.
- \`browser.create_tab\` — optional \`url\`. Opens a tab and returns its tabId. With a url it also starts loading it.
- \`browser.close_tab\` — \`tabId\`.
- \`tab.navigate\` — \`tabId\`, \`url\`. Returns as soon as the navigation starts; follow it with tab.wait_for_load.
- \`tab.go_back\`, \`tab.go_forward\`, \`tab.reload\` — \`tabId\`. The tab's own history buttons; like tab.navigate, follow them with tab.wait_for_load. Going back or forward fails when the history has no page in that direction.
- \`tab.wait_for_load\` — \`tabId\`, optional \`until\` (load, the default, or domcontentloaded to return once the HTML is parsed without waiting for images and other subresources), \`timeoutMs\` (default ${WAIT_FOR_LOAD_DEFAULT_MS}, max ${WAIT_FOR_LOAD_MAX_MS}). There is no network-idle option.
- \`tab.emulate\` — \`tabId\`, and either \`preset\` (iphone, ipad or desktop) or both \`width\` and \`height\`, optional \`deviceScaleFactor\`, \`mobile\`, \`userAgent\` (each overrides the preset's); or \`reset: true\` alone to clear it. Makes the tab pretend to be that device — viewport size, pixel ratio, touch support and user agent — for testing a responsive layout. It lasts until reset or the tab closes, and a new tab.emulate replaces the old one rather than adding to it. The page is not reloaded: media queries follow at once, but a page laid out before the switch (or one that picks its layout from the user agent on the server) is only faithful after tab.reload and tab.wait_for_load. A page without a meta viewport tag lays out 980px wide under a mobile device, as on a real phone. There is no geolocation, network throttling or rotation.
- \`page.elements.snapshot\` — \`tabId\`, optional \`scope\`, \`role\`, \`text\`, \`interactiveOnly\`, \`visibleOnly\`, \`limit\`, \`maxChars\`, \`cursor\`. A table of the operable elements: ref, role, name, text, value, href, flags. The \`offscreen\` flag marks an element that is rendered but scrolled out of the viewport: page.click and page.type still reach it, but page.screenshot will not show it.
- \`page.text.snapshot\` — \`tabId\`, optional \`scope\`, \`visibleOnly\`, \`limit\`, \`maxChars\`, \`cursor\`. The page's readable text, one block per line in reading order: a \`kind\` column (heading, item for a list item, row for a table row, text for anything else; a trailing \`+\` means the line continues the one above) and the text. Password and one-time-code fields are left out.
- \`page.screenshot\` — \`tabId\`. Attaches a picture of the visible area; use it for layout questions, not for reading text.
- \`page.click\` — \`tabId\`, \`ref\` or \`selector\`, optional \`button\`, \`clickCount\`. A real press at the centre of the element's on-screen part, after scrolling it into view. Refused, naming the culprit, when something else (a cookie banner, a modal) covers that point — dismiss it first.
- \`page.type\` — \`tabId\`, \`ref\` or \`selector\`, \`text\` (not \`value\`), optional \`clear\`, \`submit\`. Focuses the field and types into it.
- \`page.press_key\` — \`tabId\`, \`keys\`, optional \`ref\` or \`selector\`. Presses one chord of real keys: each key goes down in order and comes up in reverse, so \`["Control", "a"]\` is Ctrl+A and \`["Shift", "Tab"]\` moves focus back. Names: Enter, Tab, Escape, Backspace, Delete, Space, the arrows, Home, End, PageUp, PageDown, F1–F24, any single character, and the modifiers Control, Shift, Alt, Meta and ControlOrMeta (Meta on macOS, Control elsewhere — use it for copy/paste/select-all). With a target it focuses the element first; without one the keys go to whatever has focus. Use page.type for text, not this.
- \`page.select_option\` — \`tabId\`, \`ref\` or \`selector\`, and exactly one of \`value\`, \`label\` or \`index\`. Picks an option of a native \`<select>\` and fires input and change the way a user's pick does. A custom dropdown (a div that opens a list) is not a select: page.click it open, then page.click the option.
- \`page.set_checked\` — \`tabId\`, \`ref\` or \`selector\`, \`checked\`. Leaves a checkbox, radio or switch in that state: clicks it only if it is not already there, through its label when the input itself is styled out of sight, and reports if the click did not take. A radio cannot be unchecked — select another one instead.
- \`page.hover\` — \`tabId\`, \`ref\` or \`selector\`. Moves the pointer onto the element and leaves it there, to open a hover menu or show a tooltip; then take a snapshot to read what appeared. Refused, like page.click, when something else covers the element.
- \`page.scroll\` — \`tabId\`, optional \`direction\` (up/down/top/bottom, default down), \`amount\`, or a \`ref\`/\`selector\` to bring into view.
- \`page.wait_for\` — \`tabId\`, at least one of \`selector\`, \`text\` and \`url\` (every one given must hold), optional \`state\`, \`stableForMs\`, \`urlMatch\` (exact/prefix/contains, default prefix), \`timeoutMs\` (default ${WAIT_FOR_DEFAULT_MS}, max ${WAIT_FOR_MAX_MS}). \`state\` is visible (default) or hidden; attached or detached, which ignore whether it is rendered; or, for one element named by \`selector\` with no \`text\`, enabled, disabled, checked or unchecked. \`stableForMs\` makes the wait succeed only once everything has held continuously that long, which rules out catching an animation or re-render midway. \`text\` matches within one block of the page's text, case-insensitively. \`url\` is compared with the committed address, so it keeps waiting while a navigation is still in flight — use it after a click that should land on another page.

Usage:
- Start with browser.create_tab, then tab.wait_for_load, then a snapshot. A snapshot of a page that has not loaded fails rather than describing a blank document.
- To act on something: take a page.elements.snapshot, then pass a row's \`ref\` to page.click or page.type. A \`ref\` is only valid until the next snapshot or navigation; a \`selector\` never expires but is re-resolved against whatever matches now. When both are given, \`ref\` wins.
- An action reports what it did, not what the page became. Read the result with a fresh snapshot, and use page.wait_for first when the page updates asynchronously — tab.wait_for_load only answers for navigations.
- page.type does not fire a key event per character, so a page that reacts to individual keystrokes may not notice. \`submit\` presses a real Enter.
- Snapshots are paged. When the output ends with a \`# more:\` line, pass that \`cursor\` back with the same operation to continue; the cursor reads the snapshot that was already taken, so the page cannot shift under you. A cursor stops working once the tab navigates. \`limit\` sets how many rows a page holds, not how much of the page is read.
- \`scanTruncated=true\` in the header means a page budget ran out mid-scan. Paging cannot reach what it dropped — narrow the request with \`scope\`, \`role\` or \`text\` instead.
- Password, one-time-code and card fields are never projected: their text and value come back empty by design, and what you type into one is never echoed back.
- There is no \`prompt\` parameter — pages come back for you to read, not summarized by another model.
- Navigation asks the user for permission per host, the same way WebFetch does.
- If a call comes back saying the user has taken over the browser, they are driving it themselves: stop, tell them what you were doing, and ask what they want. Retrying in the same turn fails again — control returns on their next message.`
