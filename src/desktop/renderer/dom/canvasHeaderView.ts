/**
 * The canvas header bar: session identity on the left, "open in editor" on the
 * right (`design_guidance.md` 三.1, minus the two items with no backend).
 *
 * Two things here are load-bearing rather than tidy:
 *
 * 1. **The rename input is a persistent node.** This header repaints on every
 *    `onShellChanged`, which includes every snapshot tick of a streaming turn —
 *    a field rebuilt inside `replace()` would lose the caret, and its value,
 *    mid-word. Same shape as the sidebar's search box (5b) and the settings
 *    screen's (5f): built once, moved in and out of the flow, and written back
 *    exactly once — on the idle→renaming transition.
 * 2. **The `⋯` menu closes three ways**: a press outside the menu itself
 *    (`dom/dismiss.ts`), focus leaving the header, and Escape. The first is what
 *    makes the other two enough — this header repaints the trigger out from
 *    under the click that opened the menu, so by the user's next click there is
 *    nothing focused inside to fire a `focusout` at all. Opening the menu also
 *    moves focus onto its first item, which is what puts the keyboard back in it.
