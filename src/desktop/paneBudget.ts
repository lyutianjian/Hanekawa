/**
 * How many panes stay resident, and which ones go when there are too many.
 *
 * Clicking a session in the sidebar opens it as a lane and *keeps it alive* —
 * that is the whole point of the single-window design: a background pane keeps
 * streaming and its prompts keep parking until the user comes back. Which means
 * a long afternoon of browsing history would otherwise accumulate one
 * `SessionHost`, one `AgentLoop` and one `FileHistoryService` per session
 * clicked. This module is the cap.
 *
 * Pure and free of both DOM and Electron, for the same reason `model/` is: the
 * decision is what has to be tested, and the application of it (`closePane` on
 * the chosen lane's client) is two lines in `app.ts`.
 *
 * Eviction is not closing a session — the session stays on disk and reopening it
 * costs a fresh pane. It is releasing the *runtime*, which is why nothing here
 * asks whether the session has unsaved anything.
