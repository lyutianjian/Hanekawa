/**
 * The empty-state welcome screen, as data.
 *
 * Drawn in place of a conversation when there is nothing to read yet: a
 * masthead (a wordmark and the Hero line naming the project) hung off a single
 * brand-coloured rule, a strip of context pills, and one line of key hints.
 * `dom/welcomeView.ts` builds the nodes; every decision — above all *whether it
 * shows at all* — is here, where it can be tested without a DOM.
 *
 * The pills used to be three, all read-only, and the Hero's project name used to
 * be a button opening a workspace switcher. Both of those are gone: a「本地」pill
 * naming the one runtime that has ever existed carried no information, and the
 * switcher hung off the Hero *sentence*, where its popover was clipped by the
 * canvas. What is left is the project it runs in and the branch it is on — and
 * both are things worth changing from here, so both pills are controls, with the
 * same shape and the same popover shell (`model/projectPicker.ts`,
 * `model/branchPicker.ts`). The Hero's project name stays a plain `<span>`: the
 * switcher belongs on the pill, which is a pill-shaped control in a row of them,
 * not in the middle of a sentence.
 *
 * There is no graphic mark. The screen used to open with an icon above three
 * guidance cards, which is the shape every agent shell ships and therefore the
 * shape none of them is recognised by; the identity is carried by type instead —
 * the wordmark's tracking, the Hero's serif at display size, and the 2px rule
 * the whole block hangs on. The rule is the only "graphic", and it is a token
 * (`--accent-brand`), not a drawing.
 *
 * The cards went with it. They were guidance, not templates — clicking one only
 * focused the composer — and the hint line does that job in one row: it names
 * the three affordances a new user cannot guess (`/`, `@`, the permission
 * chord) instead of restating what a coding agent is for.
