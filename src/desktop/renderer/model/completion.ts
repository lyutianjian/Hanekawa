/**
 * The completion dropdown, over two sources that behave differently.
 *
 * Slash commands are answered synchronously from a list the client already
 * holds. File mentions are not: `generateFileSuggestions` reads the filesystem
 * and cannot cross into the bundle, so every keystroke inside an `@…` token is
 * an IPC round trip. Nothing orders those answers — a request for `@src/d` can
 * settle after the request for `@src/de` that followed it — so the state carries
 * a monotonic `seq` and `applyFileResponse` drops anything that is not the
 * answer to the newest request.
 *
 * That guard lives here rather than in `app.ts` for the usual reason: a `model/`
 * module is compiled in the base tsconfig program, which has no DOM lib, so a
 * decision is only testable if it is DOM-free. `test/rendererCompletion.test.ts`
 * drives it with responses delivered deliberately out of order.
 *
 * The two sources are also *keyboard*-different — see `acceptOnly` below.
