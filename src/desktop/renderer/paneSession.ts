/**
 * One lane's worth of renderer state.
 *
 * The single-window shell keeps N panes alive at once, and everything that
 * belongs to exactly one conversation lives here: the session client, the
 * transcript state *and its own DOM subtree* (visibility-toggled, so a switch
 * repaints nothing and scroll positions survive), the four blocking-request
 * dialogs, completions, the queue strip's mirror, the surface picker state,
 * the rewind panel, and the composer draft while the pane is in the
 * background.
 *
 * Everything else — the status bar, the composer, the tab bar, the overlay
 * panels — is a singleton the *active* pane drives. A background pane still
 * folds every event into its state (a permission request parks; a turn keeps
 * streaming), it just does not paint. `activate()` replays the whole surface
 * once, which is the entire cost of switching.
 *
 * Same rules as the old `app.ts`: decisions live in `model/`, this file only
 * wires them; a blocking request must always be answered; the draft is only
 * authoritative in the composer while active and is banked on `deactivate()`.
