 * `AbortSignal`. Anything more would have to be cloned on every post, and
 * would leak the host's internal shape into the renderer bundle.
 *
 * `send` accepts `unknown` rather than `HostCommand` because the renderer
 * builds a JSON-style envelope at the call site (the protocol's
 * `zod/v3` validator runs host-side, not here), and a hand-built command
 * shape would mean two type definitions in the renderer bundle for the same
 * thing. The receiving `parseHostCommand` is the source of truth on shapes.
