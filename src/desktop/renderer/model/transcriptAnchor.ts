 * the previous one — `.transcript-column`'s `margin-top: auto` pins a short
 * conversation against the composer, so the bubble appeared at the bottom of the
 * canvas and the answer had a few lines to grow into. The turn in flight is the
 * thing the reader is actually looking at, so it should own the screen: the new
 * bubble rises to the top of the viewport and the answer streams down the empty
 * canvas below it.
 *
 * A scroller cannot scroll past its content, so lifting the last bubble to the
 * top means putting something under it. That something is the reading column's
 * bottom padding — a written number rather than a spacer element, because a new
 * last child would be a scroll-anchor candidate and the sheet's
 * `overflow-anchor` invariant forbids switching that off to compensate. It
 * travels as a custom property, the same door `--context-ratio` uses: the
 * declaration and its fallback stay in the stylesheet, and only the number no
 * stylesheet can compute comes from here.
 *
 * This file owns the number and nothing else. Pure and DOM-free like the rest of
 * `model/`; `dom/transcriptView.ts` does the measuring and the writing.
