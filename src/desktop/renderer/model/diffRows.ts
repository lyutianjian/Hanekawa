/**
 * A file-tool preview turned into rows a view can paint one per line.
 *
 * `PermissionRequestDto.preview` arrives as two whole strings (`oldText` /
 * `newText`) already bounded by `capFileToolPreview`; turning them into a diff
 * is the viewer's job, which is why `src/tui/diff.ts` stayed in the TUI. This is
 * the DOM half of that decision, kept pure and line-oriented because a browser
 * can afford real line numbers and a gutter.
 *
 * The same rows also carry the *editing tools'* own unified patches
 * (`parseUnifiedPatch`): the tool ships the patch in `display.detail` (T12), the
 * transcript parses it back (T13), and the permission dialog and a tool step
 * share one diff look.
 *
 * DOM-free on purpose: `test/` imports this module, and a test import drags a
 * file into the base tsconfig program, which has no DOM lib. See
 * `renderer/bridgeChannel.ts` for the same reason.
