/**
 * The status bar: what the session has spent, and what it cost.

 * Split out of `composerView.ts` in 4e, when the composer grew its action bar
 * and the one file stopped being one thing. Three fields have since left it,
 * all for the same reason — one field, one place, or they drift:
 *
 * - the model, to the composer's chip beside the effort level it is read with;
 * - the permission mode (5e), to the composer's pill, beside the message it
 *   governs; and the session name, to the canvas header, which owns identity;
 * - the 生成中 label, to nowhere: the transcript and the stop button both say a
 *   turn is running, and this strip is for the numbers.
 *
 * `document.title` still happens here rather than in the header, and that is
 * deliberate: it is the desktop shell's end-to-end proof (the smoke driver reads
 * it from outside the process), and it means "a `hello()` came back" only as
 * long as it is written on the pane's path rather than off the lane list.
