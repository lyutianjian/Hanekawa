 * Its own module rather than a closure in `main.ts`, because `main.ts` has no
 * unit test (`app.requestSingleInstanceLock()` runs at import time) and the
 * platform branch below is exactly the kind of thing that is wrong in one
 * direction and silently fine in the other.
 *
 * Fixed to VS Code by the stage-5 decision table: no editor setting, no
 * `$EDITOR` lookup, one readable error when it is not installed.
 *
 * **Windows.** `code` there is `code.cmd`, which Node has refused to spawn
 * directly since 18.20 — so the command is `cmd.exe /c code "<cwd>"` with
 * `windowsVerbatimArguments`, and the path is quoted here by hand. That quoting
 * is safe rather than merely conventional: a Windows path cannot contain a
 * double quote, so the closing quote cannot be forged and `&` inside it stays
 * data. On POSIX there is no shell and the path is one `argv` entry.
