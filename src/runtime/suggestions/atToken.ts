/**
 * The half of `@` file completion that a browser can run.
 *
 * `fileSuggestions.ts` needs `node:fs`, `node:path`, `fuse.js` and the gitignore
 * reader to *find* candidates, none of which a renderer bundle can carry. But
 * deciding **where the `@` token starts** and **what the text looks like after
 * accepting one** is pure string work, and both shells need exactly that: the
 * host searches, the view splices.
 *
 * So the split is by dependency, not by convenience. Everything here has no
 * imports beyond the type above, which is what lets this module sit on
 * `test/rendererImports.test.ts`'s allowlist — that test opens every allowlisted
 * file and fails on any `node:` value import other than `node:crypto`.
 * `fileSuggestions.ts` re-exports all four names, so no existing caller moved.
