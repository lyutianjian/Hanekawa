/**
 * The ten acceptance items of stage 4, one named step each — except item 4,
 * which has two: S4 deletes an open session with other lanes around it, S4b
 * deletes the window's last one (D1). Item 8 has two as well: S8 is the settings
 * screen, and S11 is the theme that lives on its 外观 page (todo V9). Neither is
 * an eleventh acceptance item; both ride the number of the item they extend.
 *
 * Ordering is a set of constraints, not a preference:
 *
 * - **S7 first**: one lane, no side effects. A failure here means keys are not
 *   reaching the app at all, and there is no point spending 90 seconds on S6 to
 *   learn the same thing.
 * - **S2 before S6**: S6 reuses S2's mechanism — a parked permission prompt — as
 *   the deterministic pin for "never evict a blocked pane".
 * - **S6 before S3/S4**: S6 leaves four open lanes and several closed sessions,
 *   which is exactly the state S3 (delete a closed session) and S4 (delete an
 *   open one) need.
 * - **S5 after S3/S4, before S8**: S5 wants a low lane count so opening project B
 *   does not evict something mid-assertion, and S8 wants two of project A's lanes
 *   still open to observe a config fan-out across lanes.
 * - **S9 before S1**: "subsequent turns reflect it" is only observable if the
 *   effort change precedes the one paid turn.
 * - **S11 between S9 and S1**: it is the one step that changes how everything
 *   looks, so it runs after every other visual screenshot has been taken in the
 *   dark theme. It also leans on the settings screen and the composer popovers,
 *   which S8 and S9 have proved by then — so a red S11 is about the theme.
 * - **S1 last of the paid ones**: the only step that spends money. Everything
 *   else fails before the charge.
 * - **S4b after S1**: it collapses the window to a single lane (project B
 *   included, which shuts that project down), so nothing may need a lane after
 *   it. It is also the one step whose regression takes the whole app down.
 *
 * Item 10 is not a step: it is the harness's own before/after process accounting.
 *
 * Three app facts shape the assertions below, and each one invalidates the
 * obvious version of a check:
 *
 * 1. **A background pane does not repaint.** `renderTranscript` and friends
 *    early-return when the pane is inactive (`paneSession.ts:224-236`). So "the
 *    turn keeps streaming while you are away" cannot be observed as text growing
 *    in a hidden pane; it is the badge, plus the frozen length, plus the jump on
 *    return.
 * 2. **`set-startup-permission-mode` is startup-only** (`shellHost.ts:1157`,
 *    `sessionScope.ts:74`). The status bar moves after a restart, not on save —
 *    so item 8's "the status bar follows" splits in two, and only the provider
 *    half is immediate.
 * 3. **The composer is `display:none` while settings are open**
 *    (`styles.css:814-819`), so "does the long form push the composer out of the
 *    window" is really "does `#settings-body` scroll inside itself".

 * The S26 image-attachment pass, against real image bytes on the real wire.
 *
 * The model never needs to accept an image for this step to be honest about
 * delivery: a fixture image is *stored* by the host's import command, referenced
 * by the submit that follows it, and turned down by the host's own pre-flight
 * gate — the same code path (S15/S19) that would carry it into a request, minus
 * the provider. What that proves is the whole renderer → wire → store →
 * submission chain; the payload half is covered by S17/S18's tests and the paid
 * turn is a different step's business.
 *
 * Capability comes from a scratch endpoint and model the step itself creates:
 * the developer's own config is captured and restored byte for byte by the
 * harness, so writing an image-capable `smoke-img-model` into it for the length
 * of this step is the same deal S8's `smoke-endpoint` already has. The provider
 * behind it is `anthropic` but nothing is ever sent to it — every submit below
 * is either gated or aimed at a *second*, non-capable model.
 *
 * Ordering: after S9 (the composer is proven), before S11 (it leaves the run in
 * the dark theme the screenshots prefer).

 * assertion can go; the pixels are a human's job.
 *
 * **Dark is forced first, deliberately.** The developer's own machine may sit in
 * light already (the preference is `system` by default), and then "every token
 * changed" would pass on nothing at all.
