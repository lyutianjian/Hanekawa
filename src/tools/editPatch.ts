 * edit exist, and in `acceptEdits` / `bypass` mode there is no permission
 * request at all. So the tools emit the patch themselves, in one shared format,
 * at the moment they still hold both texts.
 *
 * The text is standard unified diff (`--- a/…` / `+++ b/…` / `@@` hunks) with
 * one deliberate deviation: when the patch is capped it ends with a bare
 * elision line (see `ELISION_PREFIX`) that carries no diff prefix, so a reader
 * that only knows `+`/`-`/` `/`@@` can tell it apart from real content.
