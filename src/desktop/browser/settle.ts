/**
 * Waiting for the page to stop moving: the network quiet, no animation that
 * will end still running, fonts in, and the layout the same on two polls.
 *
 * The point is the report as much as the wait. A screenshot taken while a
 * drawer is still sliding is not a bug in the drawer, and a model shown one
 * without being told will go and "fix" it. So the answer always says whether
 * the page settled — and when it did not, what was still going on.
 *
 * Never a failure: a page that stays busy (a ticking clock, a beacon every
 * second) runs into the cap and the caller carries on with what it has. The
 * one exception is the caller's own abort or a takeover, raised by `check`.
 *
 * Electron-free like `wait.ts`, and for the same reason.
